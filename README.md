# One_Nails

Summary - One Nails is a family business with over 30 years of experience in completing nail care for men and women. One Nails has its specialty of silk nails, which is a unique type of nail care that many customers have never experienced before. When the customers come to One Nails, they will also have a chance to experience many different services, including nail tip overlayed, European spa pedicure, nail art, French tip, and more.

This is the very first project that I worked on for the first year attending Dixie State University. After taking the Web 1400 course and learning about HTML and CSS, I wanted to use my knowledge to solve real world problems; in this case, I started with creating a website to focus on marketing and helping customers to learn more about One Nails. Overall, the website, as I look back now, was very basic, but I definitely learned a lot about creating, designing a website, and making a website responsive. While working on this project, I also learned about the basic of PHP since I wanted to have a form where the customers could visit, ask questions or make appointments, and send the message directly to the business's owner's email address without leaving the page.

This is the link to the website. Please feel free to check it out and give me feedback, thank you!
